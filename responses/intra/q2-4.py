The given code defines a Graph class with the following methods:

1. `__init__(self, V)`: Initializes the graph with the given number of vertices, V.
2. `addEdge(self, v, w)`: Adds an undirected edge between vertices v and w.
3. `findShortestPath(self, s, d)`: This method is not implemented and is left for you to implement. It should find the most direct path between the source node s and the destination node d, using the algorithms provided.
4. `BFS(self, s, d)`: Implements the Breadth First Search algorithm to find the shortest path between the node s and the node d. It returns the distance (number of edges) between the two nodes.
5. `printAllPaths(self, s, d)`: Prints all possible paths between the node s and the node d.

To use this class, you can create an instance of the Graph class and utilize its methods to add edges, find the shortest path, or print all paths between nodes.
