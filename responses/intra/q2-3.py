The 'findShortestPath' function uses Breadth-First Search (BFS) to find the shortest path from node 's' to node 'd' in the graph. It utilizes the 'BFS' method to perform the actual BFS traversal.

Here's the implementation of the 'findShortestPath' function:

```python
def findShortestPath(self, s, d):
    return self.BFS(s, d)
```

The function simply calls the 'BFS' method with the source node 's' and destination node 'd' as parameters, and returns the result of the BFS traversal, which is the shortest distance from 's' to 'd'.
