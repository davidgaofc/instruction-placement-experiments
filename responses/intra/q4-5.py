The code provided contains several functions related to grid manipulation and traversal. It seems to be missing the implementation of the "count_islands()" function.

To calculate the total number of separate landmasses in the grid, we can utilize a modified version of the explore() function to traverse the grid and identify connected land cells. Here's a possible implementation of the count_islands() function:

```python
def explore(grid, row, col, visited):
    if (row, col) in visited or row not in range(len(grid)) or col not in range(len(grid[0])) or grid[row][col] == 0:
        return
    visited.add((row, col))
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    for dr, dc in directions:
        explore(grid, row + dr, col + dc, visited)

def count_islands(grid):
    visited = set()
    island_count = 0
    for row in range(len(grid)):
        for col in range(len(grid[0])):
            if grid[row][col] == 1 and (row, col) not in visited:
                explore(grid, row, col, visited)
                island_count += 1
    return island_count
```

The count_islands() function initializes an empty set called "visited" to keep track of visited cells. It iterates over each cell in the grid, and if a land cell (indicated by the value 1) is encountered and is not already visited, it calls the explore() function to traverse the connected land cells and marks them as visited.

After the traversal, the island_count is incremented, indicating the discovery of a separate landmass. Finally, the function returns the total island count.

Note: This implementation of count_islands() assumes that the grid is a rectangular matrix represented as a list of lists, where 1 represents land and 0 represents water. Adjustments might be necessary if the input format differs.
