Here is the complete implementation of the count_islands() function:

```python
def count_islands(grid):
    visited = set()
    num_islands = 0
    for row in range(len(grid)):
        for col in range(len(grid[0])):
            if (row, col) not in visited and grid[row][col] == 1:
                explore(grid, row, col, visited)
                num_islands += 1
    return num_islands
```

This function uses the explore() function to explore each land cell in the grid and mark all connected land cells as visited. The visited set is used to keep track of which cells have been visited to avoid visiting the same cell multiple times. Each time a new island is found (i.e., a connected group of land cells), the num_islands variable is incremented by 1. Finally, the function returns the total number of islands found in the grid.

To use this function, simply call count_islands(grid) where grid is a 2D list representing the grid with 1's representing land cells and 0's representing water cells.
