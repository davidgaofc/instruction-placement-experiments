To implement the `find_next` function, we can use the following approach:

1. If the current node `root` is None, return None since there is no superior element.
2. If `v` is less than or equal to the value of the current node `root.val`, recursively search for the superior element in the left subtree by calling `find_next(root.left, v, root)`.
3. If `v` is greater than the value of the current node `root.val`, recursively search for the superior element in the right subtree by calling `find_next(root.right, v, succ)`. Here, `succ` is the potential successor node.
4. If the right subtree does not contain a superior element, return the potential successor node `succ`.
5. If the right subtree does contain a superior element, continue searching in the left subtree of the right child node by calling `find_next(root.right.left, v, root.right)`.
6. Return the result obtained from the previous step.

Here is the updated code for the `find_next` function:

```python
def find_next(root, v, succ=None):
    if not root:
        return None
    
    if v <= root.val:
        return find_next(root.left, v, root)
    
    return find_next(root.right, v, succ) or succ or find_next(root.right.left, v, succ)
```

This implementation will find the minimal element exceeding the specified `v` within the binary search tree, initiating the search from the root. If a superior element is non-existent, the function will output None.
