To implement the 'findShortestPath' function, we can use a modified version of the BFS (Breadth-First Search) algorithm.

Here's the implementation of the 'findShortestPath' function:

```python
def findShortestPath(self, s, d):
    visited = [False] * self.V
    queue = [(s, [])]  # Each element in the queue is a tuple (vertex, path)
    visited[s] = True

    while queue:
        v, path = queue.pop(0)
        if v == d:
            return path + [v]  # Add the destination vertex to the path
        for i in self.adj[v]:
            if not visited[i]:
                queue.append((i, path + [v]))  # Append the current vertex to the path
                visited[i] = True

    return []  # If there is no path between the source and destination, return an empty list
```

Explanation:

1. We initialize a list 'visited' to keep track of visited vertices and a queue 'queue' to perform BFS.
2. We start by enqueuing the source vertex 's' along with an empty path.
3. In the while loop, we dequeue a vertex 'v' and the corresponding path from the queue.
4. If the current vertex 'v' is equal to the destination vertex 'd', we return the path along with the destination vertex itself.
5. Otherwise, we iterate through all the adjacent vertices of 'v'. If an adjacent vertex 'i' is not visited before, we enqueue it along with the updated path (which includes the current vertex 'v').
6. We mark the adjacent vertex 'i' as visited.
7. After the while loop ends, if there is no path between the source and destination, we return an empty list.

Note: The 'path' in this implementation is a list that represents the sequence of vertices from the source to the current vertex. The implementation keeps appending the current vertex to the path when enqueuing it.
