To efficiently compute the minimal sequence between vertices 's' and 'd' in the given graph, we can use a modified version of the Breadth First Search algorithm.

1. Create a boolean array "visited" of size V, initialized with all False values.
2. Create a queue and enqueue the source vertex 's'.
3. Mark source vertex 's' as visited.
4. Create a dictionary "prev" to store the previous vertex for each visited vertex.
5. While the queue is not empty:
     - Dequeue a vertex v from the queue.
     - If v is the destination vertex 'd', break the loop.
     - For each adjacent vertex u of v:
       - If u is not visited:
         - Mark u as visited.
         - Update the "prev" dictionary with u as the previous vertex for v.
         - Enqueue u into the queue.
6. If we have reached the destination vertex 'd' by traversing the graph, reconstruct the shortest path from 's' to 'd' using the "prev" dictionary.
   - Initialize an empty list "path".
   - Starting from 'd', add each vertex to the "path" list in reverse order by finding the previous vertex from the "prev" dictionary.
   - Reverse the "path" list to get the shortest path from 's' to 'd'.

Here is the implementation of the modified findShortestPath method:

```python
def findShortestPath(self, s, d):
    visited = [False] * self.V
    queue = [(s, -1)]       # Use -1 as the initial previous vertex for the source vertex
    visited[s] = True
    prev = {}               # Dictionary to store the previous vertex for each visited vertex
    while queue:
        v, prev_v = queue.pop(0)
        if v == d:
            break
        for i in self.adj[v]:
            if not visited[i]:
                visited[i] = True
                prev[i] = v    # Store the previous vertex for i
                queue.append((i, v))
    
    if d not in prev:
        return []   # No path exists between s and d
    
    path = []
    current = d
    while current != -1:   # Reconstruct the shortest path from d to s
        path.append(current)
        current = prev.get(current, -1)
    
    path.reverse()   # Reverse the path to get the shortest path from s to d
    return path
```
This method returns the shortest path from vertex 's' to vertex 'd' as a list of vertices. If no path exists between 's' and 'd', it returns an empty list.
