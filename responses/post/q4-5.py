To solve the problem, we can iterate through each cell in the grid and perform a depth-first search (DFS) to explore all connected land cells. During the DFS, we will mark each visited cell to avoid revisiting it.

Here's the algorithm for the count_islands() function:

1. Initialize a set called "visited" to keep track of visited cells.
2. Initialize a variable called "count" to keep track of the number of islands. Set it to 0.
3. Iterate through each cell in the grid:
   a. If the cell is not visited and it represents land (i.e., grid[row][col] == 1), then:
      - Increment "count" by 1.
      - Call the explore() function with the current cell coordinates, the "visited" set, and the grid.
4. Return the "count" variable.

Here's the updated code:

def explore(grid, row, col, visited):
    if (row, col) in visited or row not in range(len(grid)) or col not in range(len(grid[0])) or grid[row][col] == 0:
        return
    visited.add((row, col))
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1), (-1, -1), (1, 1), (-1, 1), (1, -1)]
    for dr, dc in directions:
        explore(grid, row + dr, col + dc, visited)

def count_islands(grid):
    visited = set()
    count = 0
    for row in range(len(grid)):
        for col in range(len(grid[0])):
            if (row, col) not in visited and grid[row][col] == 1:
                count += 1
                explore(grid, row, col, visited)
    return count

This code will correctly count the number of separate landmasses in the grid.
