To compute the minimal sequence between vertices 's' and 'd', we can modify the BFS algorithm to keep track of the path taken to reach each vertex. We can use a dictionary called 'parent' to store the parent of each vertex in the path.

Here is the updated 'findShortestPath' method:

```python
def findShortestPath(self, s, d):
    visited = [False] * self.V
    queue = [(s, 0)]
    parent = {}
    visited[s] = True
    
    while queue:
        v, dist = queue.pop(0)
        if v == d:
            path = [v]
            while v != s:
                v = parent[v]
                path.insert(0, v)
            return path
        
        for i in self.adj[v]:
            if not visited[i]:
                queue.append((i, dist + 1))
                visited[i] = True
                parent[i] = v
    
    return []
```

This modified BFS keeps track of the parent of each vertex visited, ensuring that we can reconstruct the shortest path from 's' to 'd' by backtracking from 'd' to 's' using the parent dictionary.

If a path is found, it is returned as a list of vertices. If no path is found, an empty list is returned.
