To count the number of islands in the grid, we can iterate through each cell in the grid. For each cell, if it is a 1 and not already visited, we will perform a DFS exploration to mark all connected 1s as visited. After the exploration, we increment the island count and continue to the next cell.

The count_islands() function can be implemented as follows:

```python
def count_islands(grid):
    if not grid or not grid[0]:
        return 0
    
    num_rows = len(grid)
    num_cols = len(grid[0])
    visited = set()
    island_count = 0
    
    for row in range(num_rows):
        for col in range(num_cols):
            if grid[row][col] == 1 and (row, col) not in visited:
                # Explore the current island
                explore(grid, row, col, visited)
                island_count += 1
    
    return island_count
```

Now, the count_islands() function will iterate through each cell in the grid. If the cell is a 1 and has not been visited before, it will call the explore() function to mark all connected 1s as visited. After exploring all connected 1s, it increments the island count and continues to the next cell.

Please note that the explore() function needs to be defined as well. Here is the complete code with the explore() function:

```python
def explore(grid, row, col, visited):
    if (row, col) in visited or row not in range(len(grid)) or col not in range(len(grid[0])) or grid[row][col] == 0:
        return
    visited.add((row, col))
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1), (-1, -1), (1, 1), (-1, 1), (1, -1)]
    for dr, dc in directions:
        explore(grid, row + dr, col + dc, visited)
```

The explore() function checks if the current cell is already visited, out of bounds, or not part of the island (0). If any of these conditions are met, it returns. Otherwise, it marks the cell as visited and explores the neighboring cells in all directions.

With these implementations, the count_islands() function will correctly count the number of islands in the grid.
