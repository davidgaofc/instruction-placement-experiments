To find the quickest route from 's' to 'd' in the given graph, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm.

Dijkstra's algorithm is a greedy algorithm that finds the shortest path between a starting node and all other nodes in a graph. It works by maintaining a set of unvisited nodes and their tentative distances from the starting node. In each iteration, it selects the node with the smallest tentative distance, updates the distances of its neighboring nodes, and marks the selected node as visited. This process is repeated until all nodes have been visited or the destination node 'd' is reached.

We can modify the 'findShortestPath' method to implement Dijkstra's algorithm as follows:

```python
import heapq

class Graph:
    def __init__(self, V):
        self.V = V
        self.adj = [[] for _ in range(V)]

    def addEdge(self, v, w):
        self.adj[v].append(w)
        self.adj[w].append(v)

    def findShortestPath(self, s, d):
        distance = [float('inf')] * self.V
        distance[s] = 0
        visited = [False] * self.V
        pq = [(0, s)]
        while pq:
            dist, u = heapq.heappop(pq)
            if visited[u]:
                continue
            visited[u] = True
            if u == d:
                return dist
            for v in self.adj[u]:
                if not visited[v] and dist + 1 < distance[v]:
                    distance[v] = dist + 1
                    heapq.heappush(pq, (dist + 1, v))
        return float('inf')
```

In the modified 'findShortestPath' method, we maintain a 'distance' array to store the tentative distances from the starting node 's' to each node in the graph. Initially, all distances are set to infinity except for the distance from 's' to itself, which is 0.

We also maintain a priority queue 'pq' to keep track of the nodes and their tentative distances. The priority queue is implemented using a min-heap data structure.

In each iteration, we extract the node with the smallest tentative distance from the priority queue. If the node has already been visited, we continue to the next iteration. Otherwise, we mark the node as visited, check if it is the destination node 'd', and return the tentative distance if it is. Otherwise, we update the distances of its neighboring nodes if the path through the current node has a smaller distance.

Finally, if we have visited all nodes without reaching the destination node 'd', we return infinity, indicating that there is no path from 's' to 'd'.
