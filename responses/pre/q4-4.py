To implement the count_islands() function, we can use a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm to explore each island in the grid. The explore() function is already provided and can be used to traverse the grid and mark visited locations. The steps to count the islands are as follows:

1. Initialize a variable called "count" to keep track of the number of islands.
2. Initialize an empty set called "visited" to store the visited locations.
3. Iterate over each cell in the grid using two nested loops.
4. If a cell contains a land (1) and is not visited, increment the count and call the explore() function to traverse the island and mark visited locations.
5. After exploring an island, add all the visited locations to the "visited" set.
6. Finally, return the count of islands.

Here is the code for the count_islands() function:

```python
def count_islands(grid):
    count = 0
    visited = set()
    for row in range(len(grid)):
        for col in range(len(grid[0])):
            if grid[row][col] == 1 and (row, col) not in visited:
                explore(grid, row, col, visited)
                count += 1
    return count
```

This implementation will count the number of distinct islands in the grid. The explore() function will mark the visited locations, ensuring that each island is counted only once.
