To implement the `findShortestPath` function, we can modify the existing `BFS` function to keep track of the path as well. We can use a dictionary to store the parent node of each visited node during the BFS traversal.

Here is the modified code for the `findShortestPath` function:

```python
def findShortestPath(self, s, d):
    visited = [False] * self.V
    queue = [(s, 0)]
    visited[s] = True
    parent = {}

    while queue:
        v, dist = queue.pop(0)
        if v == d:
            path = [d]
            while v != s:
                path.append(parent[v])
                v = parent[v]
            path.reverse()
            return path

        for i in self.adj[v]:
            if not visited[i]:
                queue.append((i, dist + 1))
                visited[i] = True
                parent[i] = v

    return []
```

In this modified code, after finding the destination node `d`, we trace back the path from `d` to `s` using the `parent` dictionary. We start from `d` and follow the parent nodes until we reach `s`. Finally, we reverse the path since we constructed it from `d` to `s` but the desired output is from `s` to `d`.
