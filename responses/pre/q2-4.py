To implement the `findShortestPath` function, we can utilize the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm. This algorithm finds the shortest path between two vertices in an unweighted graph.

Here is the updated code:

```python
class Graph:
    def __init__(self, V):
        self.V = V
        self.adj = [[] for _ in range(V)]

    def addEdge(self, v, w):
        self.adj[v].append(w)
        self.adj[w].append(v)

    def findShortestPath(self, s, d):
        visited = [False] * self.V
        queue = [(s, 0)]
        visited[s] = True
        while queue:
            v, dist = queue.pop(0)
            if v == d:
                return dist
            for i in self.adj[v]:
                if not visited[i]:
                    queue.append((i, dist + 1))
                    visited[i] = True
        return float('inf')

    def printAllPaths(self, s, d):
        visited = [False] * self.V
        path = []
        self._printAllPathsUtil(s, d, visited, path)

    def _printAllPathsUtil(self, u, d, visited, path):
        visited[u], path = True, path + [u]
        if u == d:
            print(path)
        else:
            for i in self.adj[u]:
                if not visited[i]:
                    self._printAllPathsUtil(i, d, visited, path)
        path.pop()
        visited[u] = False
```

In the `findShortestPath` function, the BFS algorithm is used to find the shortest path between nodes `s` and `d`. The function initializes a `visited` list to keep track of visited nodes, a queue to store nodes to be processed, and a distance variable to track the current distance from the source node `s` to the current node being visited. 

The algorithm starts by adding the source node `s` to the queue with a distance of 0. Then, it enters a loop that continues until the queue is empty. In each iteration, the algorithm dequeues a node `v` from the queue and checks if it is the destination node `d`. If it is, the algorithm returns the distance. Otherwise, it iterates over the adjacent nodes of `v` and adds them to the queue if they have not been visited before. The distance of the adjacent nodes is incremented by 1 compared to the current node.

If the destination node is not found during the BFS, the function returns `float('inf')` to indicate that there is no path between the source and destination nodes.

You can test the function by creating a graph object and adding edges using the `addEdge` method. Then, you can call the `findShortestPath` method with the source and destination nodes to find the shortest path between them.
