To implement the count_islands() algorithm, we can use a depth-first search (DFS) approach. The algorithm starts by iterating over each cell in the grid. If the cell is a land (1) and has not been visited before, it increments the island count and explores all adjacent land cells using the explore() function.

Here's the implementation of the count_islands() algorithm:

```python
def count_islands(grid):
    visited = set()
    island_count = 0

    for row in range(len(grid)):
        for col in range(len(grid[0])):
            if (row, col) not in visited and grid[row][col] == 1:
                explore(grid, row, col, visited)
                island_count += 1

    return island_count
```

The algorithm maintains a set of visited cells to avoid redundant exploration. The explore() function is responsible for the DFS traversal of the grid. It checks if the current cell is within the valid range, is a land cell, and has not been visited before. If these conditions are satisfied, it marks the cell as visited and recursively explores all adjacent land cells.

Note: The explore() function is assumed to be correct and is provided separately.
